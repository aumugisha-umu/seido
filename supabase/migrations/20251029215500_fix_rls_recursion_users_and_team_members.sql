-- Migration: Fix RLS recursion between users and team_members
-- Problem: Circular dependency between users and team_members RLS policies
--
-- Root Cause:
-- 1. users table policy: team_id IN (SELECT get_user_teams_v2())
-- 2. get_user_teams_v2() queries: team_members JOIN users
-- 3. users RLS is triggered again â†’ infinite recursion
--
-- Solution:
-- Simplify both policies to use direct auth.uid() checks without cross-table dependencies

-- ============================================================================
-- FIX USERS TABLE RLS POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing select policies that cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_select_own_profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_select_team_members_managers" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_select_limited_access" ON users;

-- Policy 1: Users can always see their own profile (no recursion)
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own_profile" ON users
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 2: Gestionnaires/Admins can see users in their teams
-- SIMPLIFIED: Direct query without get_user_teams_v2() to avoid recursion
CREATE POLICY "users_select_team_members_managers" ON users
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  -- User is gestionnaire or admin
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users u
    WHERE u.auth_user_id = auth.uid()

      FROM team_members tm
      INNER JOIN users u ON u.id = tm.user_id
      WHERE u.auth_user_id = auth.uid()

  )
);

-- Policy 3: Locataires/Prestataires can see managers and other members
CREATE POLICY "users_select_limited_access" ON users
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  -- User is locataire or prestataire
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users u

-- ============================================================================
-- VERIFICATION
-- ============================================================================

-- These queries should now work without recursion:
-- 1. SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid();
-- 2. SELECT * FROM team_members WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid());
-- 3. SELECT * FROM users WHERE team_id IN (...);
