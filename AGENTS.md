## Codebase Patterns (Read First!)

[Reusable, generally-applicable patterns discovered through development]

### Auth & Sessions

#### Learning #001: RLS Silent Blocks
**Problem:** Supabase upsert returns `{ data: [...], error: null }` even when RLS blocks the write — no error thrown.
**Solution:** Always check `!data` or `data.length === 0` after upsert operations, not just `error`.
**Example:** `lib/services/repositories/*.repository.ts` — all upsert methods
**When to Use:** Any INSERT/UPDATE/UPSERT through Supabase client
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Push notification subscription debugging

#### Learning #002: userProfile.id vs client userId
**Problem:** Client-side `userId` from auth can differ from `userProfile.id` in multi-team setups.
**Solution:** Always use server-side `userProfile.id` (from `getServerAuthContext`) for database operations.
**Example:** `app/api/push/subscribe/route.ts` — uses `userProfile.id` not auth userId
**When to Use:** Any operation linking data to a user identity
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Push subscription security fix

#### Learning #003: .single() vs .limit(1) for multi-team users
**Problem:** `.single()` throws error when user belongs to multiple teams (returns 2+ rows).
**Solution:** Use `.limit(1)` instead of `.single()` for queries that might return multiple rows per user.
**Example:** `lib/services/repositories/team-member.repository.ts`
**When to Use:** Any query where a user might have multiple team memberships
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Multi-team support implementation

### Database & Queries

#### Learning #004: PostgREST nested relations fail silently with RLS
**Problem:** PostgREST `select('*, table2(*)')` returns `null` for nested relations when RLS blocks access — no error.
**Solution:** Use separate queries with `Promise.all` instead of nested selects when RLS is involved.
**Example:** `lib/services/repositories/intervention.repository.ts` — separate queries pattern
**When to Use:** Any query joining tables with different RLS policies
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Intervention detail page debugging

### UI & Components

#### Learning #005: ContactSelector hideUI pattern
**Problem:** Need to reuse contact selection logic in custom modals without the default UI.
**Solution:** Use `hideUI` prop on ContactSelector to get behavior without rendering.
**Example:** `components/contacts/contact-selector.tsx`
**When to Use:** When embedding selection logic in custom modal layouts
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Provider assignment modal refactor

### Notifications

#### Learning #006: Push notification URL must be role-specific
**Problem:** Push notifications with generic URLs (e.g., `/interventions/123`) fail because each role has its own route prefix.
**Solution:** Build URLs with role prefix: `/${role}/interventions/${id}`.
**Example:** `lib/send-push-notification.ts:42`
**When to Use:** Any notification that links to an in-app page
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Push notification URL routing fix

### Interventions

#### Learning #007: Create conversation threads BEFORE assignments
**Problem:** Database triggers on `intervention_assignments` expect a conversation thread to already exist.
**Solution:** Create the conversation thread FIRST, then create the assignment. Trigger order is critical.
**Example:** `app/api/create-manager-intervention/route.ts`
**When to Use:** Any code that creates intervention assignments
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Intervention creation flow debugging

#### Learning #010: RLS Access ≠ Explicit Participation
**Problem:** Managers could view conversations via RLS (`team_id` match) but weren't in `conversation_participants`, breaking read tracking and participant lists.
**Solution:** Distinguish between RLS access (can read) and explicit participation (tracked in UI, unread counts work). Add users as participants when they interact.
**Example:** `lib/services/domain/conversation-service.ts:319-332` — auto-add on first message
**When to Use:** Any feature involving conversation visibility or participant lists
**Added:** 2026-02-06 | **Source:** Conversation participants fix

#### Learning #011: Property-linked vs Team-linked Managers
**Problem:** Adding ALL team managers to conversations was wrong — only managers responsible for the specific property should be participants.
**Solution:** Query `lot_contacts` + `building_contacts` (union) to find property-specific managers, not team membership.
**Example:** `app/api/create-intervention/route.ts:281-343`
**When to Use:** Any feature assigning managers to property-related entities (interventions, contracts, etc.)
**Added:** 2026-02-06 | **Source:** Conversation participants fix

#### Learning #012: Trigger Removal vs Application Code
**Problem:** SQL trigger `add_team_managers_to_thread` added ALL managers globally — too coarse-grained for role-specific logic.
**Solution:** Remove coarse triggers; implement fine-grained logic in application code where you have full context (user role, property links, etc.).
**Example:** Migration `20260206100000_remove_auto_add_all_managers_trigger.sql` + app code in route.ts
**When to Use:** When trigger behavior is too generic and needs role/context awareness
**Added:** 2026-02-06 | **Source:** Conversation participants fix

### Performance

#### Learning #008: Batch queries for lists (N+1 prevention)
**Problem:** Listing N interventions with N separate queries for related data causes N+1 performance issues.
**Solution:** Use `Promise.all` to batch all related queries, or fetch all related data in a single query with `in()`.
**Example:** `lib/services/domain/intervention.service.ts` — list methods
**When to Use:** Any list/table view fetching related data per row
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Dashboard performance optimization

### Testing

#### Learning #009: Test with 3 user archetypes
**Problem:** Testing with only one user type misses role-specific and permission edge cases.
**Solution:** Always test with 3 types: (1) user with account, (2) contact without account, (3) multi-team user.
**Example:** `tests/e2e/` — test fixtures
**When to Use:** Any feature touching auth, permissions, or user-specific data
**Added:** 2026-02-04 | **Source:** Multi-team support QA

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid These!)

### Infinite Refresh Loop
**Symptom:** Page keeps re-rendering, network tab shows repeated requests.
**Cause:** Effect dependency triggers itself (e.g., setting state that's also a dependency).
**Fix:** Use `useRef<Set<string>>` for `executedRef` pattern — track what's already been executed.

### Client Hook Race Condition
**Symptom:** Data appears undefined on first render, works on refresh.
**Cause:** `authLoading` not included in `useEffect` dependencies.
**Fix:** Always include `authLoading` in effect dependencies and guard with `if (authLoading) return`.

### PostgREST Nested Relations
**Symptom:** Related data is `null` even though it exists in the database.
**Cause:** RLS policy on the nested table blocks access (silent failure).
**Fix:** Use separate queries with `Promise.all` instead of nested `select()`.

### Email Template Rendering
**Symptom:** Email looks correct in preview but broken in actual email clients.
**Cause:** React Email components have different rendering in preview vs production.
**Fix:** Always test with `npx react-email dev` AND send a real test email.

## How to Add a Learning

When adding a new learning via `sp-compound`, use this format:

```markdown
#### Learning #XXX: [Short Title]
**Problem:** [What went wrong — be specific]
**Solution:** [How to fix it correctly — actionable]
**Example:** [file:line where implemented]
**When to Use:** [Context that triggers this knowledge]
**Added:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Source:** [Feature/bug that revealed this]
```

**Rules:**
- Increment the learning number from the last one in the relevant section
- Update "Total Learnings" count in the header
- If the learning is a new category, create a new `###` section
- Keep descriptions concise but actionable — write for the next agent, not yourself
