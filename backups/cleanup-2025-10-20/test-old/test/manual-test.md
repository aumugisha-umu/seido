# SEIDO Application Manual Test Report

## Test Environment
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Application URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4
- **State Management**: localStorage (Demo mode)
- **Backend**: Supabase (configured but using demo mode)

## 1. Authentication System Testing

### Test Accounts Status
| Role | Email | Password | Login Status | Comments |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Gestionnaire | arthur@umumentum.com | Wxcvbn123 | ✅ PASS | Successfully authenticated |
| Prestataire | arthur+prest@seido.pm | Wxcvbn123 | ⚠️ TIMEOUT | Login page didn't load properly |
| Locataire | arthur+loc@seido.pm | Wxcvbn123 | ⚠️ TIMEOUT | Login page didn't load properly |

### Authentication Flow Issues Found:
1. **Login page stability** - Intermittent loading issues for some attempts
2. **Session management** - Uses Supabase auth with JWT tokens
3. **Password reset flow** - Available via `/auth/reset-password` endpoint
4. **Limited test accounts** - Only 3 accounts configured (gestionnaire, prestataire, locataire)

## 2. Dashboard Functionality

### Dashboard Access by Role
| Dashboard | URL | Access Status | UI Elements |
|-----------|-----|---------------|-------------|
| Gestionnaire | /gestionnaire/dashboard | ✅ Accessible | No cards/widgets |
| Prestataire | /prestataire/dashboard | ✅ Accessible | No cards/widgets |
| Locataire | /locataire/dashboard | ✅ Accessible | No cards/widgets |

### Dashboard Issues:
1. **Empty dashboards** - All role dashboards load but display no content
2. **Missing navigation** - No header or navigation elements detected
3. **No data visualization** - Expected charts/metrics not present

## 3. Intervention Workflow

### Workflow States (Expected)
1. `nouvelle-demande` - New request from tenant
2. `approuvee` - Approved by manager
3. `programmee` - Scheduled
4. `en-cours` - In progress
5. `terminee` - Completed
6. `facturee` - Invoiced
7. `payee` - Paid
8. `annulee` - Cancelled

### Workflow Testing Status
- ⏸️ **Not testable** - Unable to test due to empty dashboards and missing UI elements

## 4. UI/UX Responsiveness ✅

### Viewport Testing Results
| Viewport | Dimensions | Status | Issues |
|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Mobile | 375x812 | ✅ PASS | Content fits, no overflow |
| Tablet | 768x1024 | ✅ PASS | Content fits, no overflow |
| Desktop | 1920x1080 | ✅ PASS | Content fits, no overflow |

## 5. Performance Metrics ✅

### Page Load Performance
- **Initial Load Time**: 1.98 seconds
- **DOM Content Loaded**: 0.1ms
- **First Paint**: 292ms
- **First Contentful Paint**: 292ms
- **Performance Rating**: GOOD ✅

## 6. Accessibility Testing ⚠️

### Accessibility Checklist
| Check | Status | Comments |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Language attribute | ✅ PASS | HTML has lang attribute |
| Page title | ✅ PASS | Title present |
| Image alt texts | ✅ PASS | All images have alt text |
| Form labels | ✅ PASS | All inputs have labels |
| Heading structure | ✅ PASS | Proper heading hierarchy |
| Skip navigation | ❌ FAIL | No skip link present |
| Button text | ✅ PASS | All buttons have text |

**Accessibility Score**: 6/7 (86%)

## 7. Critical Issues Found

### High Priority
1. **Empty Application State** - All dashboards are empty with no functional components
2. **Missing Demo Data** - No mock data is being displayed
3. **Authentication Issues** - Only 1 of 3 test accounts works reliably
4. **No Skip Navigation** - Accessibility requirement missing

### Medium Priority
1. **Missing Navigation** - No header/nav elements in dashboards
2. **No Error Messaging** - Failed logins don't always show clear errors
3. **Session Timeout Handling** - No clear indication when session expires

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Optimization** - Could improve First Paint time
2. **Loading States** - No loading indicators during page transitions

## 8. Security Observations

### Positive
- ✅ HTTPS redirect configured
- ✅ Secure cookie settings for auth
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented

### Concerns
- ⚠️ Demo mode uses localStorage (acceptable for prototype)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on login attempts
- ⚠️ No CAPTCHA on authentication forms

## 9. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Demo Data** - Ensure mock data loads in demo mode
2. **Fix Test Accounts** - Ensure all 3 role accounts work properly
3. **Add Skip Navigation** - Improve accessibility compliance
4. **Populate Dashboards** - Add demo widgets and cards

### Future Improvements
1. **Complete Intervention Workflow** - Implement full lifecycle
2. **Add Notifications** - Real-time notification system
3. **Improve Error Handling** - Better user feedback
4. **Add Loading States** - Improve perceived performance
5. **Implement Rate Limiting** - Security enhancement

## 10. Test Coverage Summary

| Area | Coverage | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Authentication | 33% | ⚠️ Partial (1 of 3 accounts working) |
| Dashboards | 40% | ⚠️ Limited |
| Workflows | 0% | ❌ Not tested |
| Availability | 0% | ❌ Not tested |
| Notifications | 0% | ❌ Not tested |
| Data Isolation | 0% | ❌ Not tested |
| UI Responsiveness | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Error Handling | 20% | ⚠️ Limited |
| Performance | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Accessibility | 86% | ✅ Good |

**Overall Test Coverage**: 37%

## Conclusion

The SEIDO application shows a solid technical foundation with good performance and responsive design. However, the application appears to be in an incomplete state with:

1. **Missing functionality** - Core features not implemented or not loading
2. **Demo mode issues** - Mock data system not functioning
3. **Limited testability** - Cannot test main workflows due to empty UI

The application needs significant work to be considered feature-complete for demonstration purposes. Priority should be given to implementing demo data and completing the core intervention workflow.
